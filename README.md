# WolfLang

WolfLang is a Lua-inspired, embeddable, statically-typed programming language.
It’s designed for scripting, quick prototyping, and embedding in larger applications.

## Features (so far)
- **Embeddable**: Can be integrated into other projects easily
- **Static typing**: Helps catch errors at compile time
- **Lua-like syntax**: Familiar and easy to learn
- **REPL**: Read-Eval-Print Loop for testing code snippets

## Planned Features
- Control flow: `if`, `while`, `for`
- User-defined functions and lexical scoping
- Lists, maps/dictionaries, modules
- Coroutines / async support
- FFI: Call C/Rust functions directly
- Optional transpiler: Convert WolfLang to Lua or C

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Build the interpreter
3. Run the REPL

> **Note:** This is an early-stage project and currently private. Features and syntax are under active development.
